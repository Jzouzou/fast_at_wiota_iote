# About WloTa Protocol
WloTa (Wide-range Intetnet Of Things communicAtion Protocol) protocol designed for the wide-area wireless loT communication is chinese independent intellectual property rights completely. 
The core characters include large coverage, low power consumption, a large number of connections, low cost, working at 230 MHZ to 470 MHZ in sub 1G spectrum.
So it is flexible and can meet the demand of Internet communication for many industries.</br>
WIoTa protocol design fully consider the diversified characteristics of IOT, adopting flexible architecture for adapting to various application requirements. 
According to the network size, multiple functional entity can be combined into a hardware entities.</br>

### Work mode
  ★ Synchronous mode</br>
      &emsp; AP network by star, point to multipoint. the system is high efficiency and has large capacity, can provide precise timing for IOT
      terminal, suitable for the special frequency band such as 230 MHZ. It support hierarchical network to enlarge the network coverage.</br>
      
  ★ Asynchronous mode</br>
      &emsp; Point to point, point to multipoint. The implementation in this mode is simple for these is no need to plan network.
      but the capacity is low than synchronous mode.
      WloTa communication protocol has also taken measures to optimize the design of the control signal and design conflict
      adjustable mechanism to maximize capacity in asynchronous mode .</br>
      
  ★ MESH mode</br>
      &emsp; This is no center mode. In asynchronous mode, the support of no center radio between IOT terminals is ebable.</br>
